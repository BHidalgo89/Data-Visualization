<h2>The graph below is a scatterplot displaying various cars as nodes.
The cars are plotted on an X-axis representing MPG and a Y-axis representing acceleration.
The radius of the nodes is directly correlated with the horsepower of a car. The color of the nodes represents the cylinders of the car,
except for the BMW 2002. The BMW 2002 is represented as a yellow node and is larger than all other nodes so the user can see our car of 
comparison.</h2>
